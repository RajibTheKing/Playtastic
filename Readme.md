# Project: "Playtastic - Funny Online Multiplayer Gaming Experience"

## Initial Plan:
Playtastic is an online multiplayer simple game platform where initial game will be read a text statement describing a place or object and guess what it is. Players compete in real-time to score points based on the accuracy of their guesses. The game will use Python Django, Go, React, Next.js, and Nest.js to provide a rich, interactive experience.

## Components and Technologies
### Backend Services

- Go: Microservice for game logic, including statement selection, validation of guesses, and scoring.
- Python Django: REST API for user authentication, profile management, and leaderboard.
Frontend Applications
- React: Main user interface for playing the game, guessing, and viewing results.
- Next.js: User profiles, leaderboards, and game history. Server-side rendering for performance and SEO.
- Nest.js: Real-time game communication, such as updates, chat, and notifications.

- Secure authentication using JWT.
- Manage leaderboards and game history.
- User Interface (React)

- Game screen with text statement display and input for guesses.
- Real-time updates of game progress and scores.
- User dashboard for managing game history and profile settings.
- User Profiles and Leaderboards (Next.js)

- User profile pages with game history and statistics.
- Leaderboards displaying top players.
- Blog section with game tips, community stories, and updates.
- Real-time Communication (Nest.js)

- In-game chat for player communication.
- Notifications for game events and updates.


## Project Structure
### Backend (Go and Django)

- Go service for game logic and validation.
- Django REST API for user management and leaderboards.
- Use Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration.
- RESTful APIs and gRPC for communication between services.
- Frontend (React and Next.js)

- React app for the game interface.
- Next.js app for user profiles and leaderboards.
- Use Tailwind CSS or Material-UI for styling.
- Real-time Services (Nest.js)

- WebSocket or Socket.IO for real-time communication.
- Integration with React and Next.js for real-time updates.
- Learning Objectives
- Go: Implement efficient game logic and real-time validation.
- Python Django: Create secure, scalable REST APIs for user management.
- React: Develop a dynamic and responsive game interface.
- Next.js: Utilize server-side rendering for profile and leaderboard pages.
- Nest.js: Implement real-time game communication and notifications.

## Steps to Get Started
### Set Up Development Environment

- Install necessary tools and frameworks (Go, Python, Node.js, etc.).
- Set up version control with Git and create a repository.
- Develop Backend Services

- Start with the Go microservice for game logic and text statement selection.
- Develop the Django REST API for user authentication and profiles.
- Build Frontend Applications

- Create the React app for the game interface.
- Develop the Next.js app for profiles and leaderboards.
- Implement Real-time Features

- Use Nest.js to add real-time updates and in-game chat.

### Testing and Deployment

- Write unit and integration tests for all services.
- Use CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- Documentation and Final Touches

- Document the code and create user guides.
- Optimize performance and ensure security best practices.
- Detailed Feature Breakdown
- Game Logic (Go)

### API Endpoints:
- GET /game/start: Start a new game round.
- POST /game/guess: Submit a guess for the current round.
- GET /game/results: Get the results of the current round.

    - Text Statement Storage: Use a database for storing and retrieving text statements.
    - Scoring System: Calculate scores based on the accuracy of guesses.
    - User Authentication and Profiles (Python Django)

### API Endpoints:
- POST /auth/register: User registration.
- POST /auth/login: User login.
- GET /users/:id: Get user profile.
- GET /leaderboard: Get leaderboard data.
    - Authentication: Use JWT for secure user authentication.
    - Profile Management: Allow users to update their profile details.
    - User Interface (React)

### Pages:
- Game: Display the game interface with text statement and input for guesses.
- Results: Show results of the current round.
Components:
- TextStatement: Display the current text statement.
- GuessInput: Input for player guesses.
- ScoreBoard: Display scores and game progress.
- User Profiles and Leaderboards (Next.js)

### Pages:
- Profile: Display user profile with game history.
- Leaderboard: Display top players.
- Server-Side Rendering: Ensure profiles and leaderboards are rendered server-side for better performance and SEO.
- Real-time Communication (Nest.js)

- WebSocket Integration: Use WebSocket or Socket.IO for real-time updates.

### Notification System:
- Notify players of new rounds and score updates.
- Provide in-game chat functionality.
